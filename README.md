# flask-chartist-example
Learning more about flask and javascript

This app is currently running on [heroku](http://still-beyond-87368.herokuapp.com/chartist)


This project will create a flask dashboard with a javascript library, and the charts will update without refreshing the page.  The charts will not be polished or excitin, this is just to explore how to create a working dashboard in python with minimal javascript to refresh the data.

## Inspiration

This project was heavily inspired by Anthony's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geKvJbQsOmM) from [Pretty Printed](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-QDfvrRIDB6F0bIO4I4HkQ)


## Example Dashboard
